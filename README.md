 backgroud to experimental determination and modern characterisation techniques for band alignment.

* A theoretical background to band alignment using plane wave density functional theory.

* Hands on practicals using [MacroDensity](http://wmd-group.github.io/MacroDensity/) to construct energy-band-alignment diagrams for
	* Bulk semicondutor materials
	* Nanoporous frameworks
	* Epitaxial heterostructures
